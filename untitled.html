              <h3> Fighting Recod</h3>
    <li>He achieves a nice VICTORY in “South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut”
      <br> against Saddam Hussein, but utilizes the power of his electronic V-Chip.</li>
    <li> Token Black and Butters hand him a DEFEAT when he fails to win them a
      <br>Platinum CD in Christian Rock Hard. </li>
    <li>He fights Kenny to a DRAW in “Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes”</li>

      <br> hands of Wendy Testaburger in “Breast Cancer Show Ever”.</li>
    <li>When Coon and Friends rebels against the Coon’s leadership in
      <br> “Coon 2: Hindsight”, he achieves a DOUBLE VICTORY against both Mosquito
      <br> and Mint-Berry Crunch as punishment for their treason... it doubles as a
      nod to ‘’A Clockwork Orange, too.</li>
    <li> A ‘sketti wrestlin’‘ match with Honey Boo Boo during “Raising the
      <br> Bar” remains pretty evenly-matched, but Cartman prevails with a        VICTORY... until Michelle Obama gets involved.</li>
